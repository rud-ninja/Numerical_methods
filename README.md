# Title: Numerical Methods

## Objectives:
1. Test 4 different numerical algorithms with varying step sizes to estimate definite integrals, namely; Euler, Midpoint, Runge Kutta 2nd order and 4th order. Compare the solutions of the above to the closed form solution.
2. Find the minima points of a given function (of order greater than 2) using gradient descent (optimisation algorithm)
3. Analyse a given dynamic system.


#### Libraries used:
Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
